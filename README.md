## **Project Description**  
**Financial Bloom** is an innovative finance-tracking app designed to help users manage their income, expenses, debt, savings, and personalized budgets. With a unique gamified approach, users' positive financial decisions contribute to the growth of a virtual garden, turning responsible spending and saving habits into a visually rewarding experience. This app simplifies financial planning, motivates users to maintain good financial habits, and encourages long-term financial health.

## **Project Overview Statement**  
**Financial Bloom** is a budgeting app that helps users manage their finances while fostering positive habits through gamification. Users' financial growth directly impacts a dynamic virtual garden, turning budgeting into an engaging experience.

## **Problem/Opportunity**  
The average American carried a total debt of $104,215 in Q3 of 2023, according to Business Insider. This debt and poor financial planning make it difficult for many Americans to build a proper savings base. For Americans under 35, the average savings balance should be $20,540, but only 41% of Americans could cover a $1,000 emergency purchase. **Financial Bloom** aims to motivate users to develop sustainable financial habits, empowering them to reduce debt, increase savings, and be more mindful of their spending choices.
