        <h1>How to Budget?</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;A common rule of thumb in budgeting is called the 50/20/30 rule. What this means is that when budgeting it is suggested to spend: 50% of your income for your needs, 20% for your savings, and 30% for leisure/luxury.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget section to the left groceries, car, and home are considered needs. The 20% of your income for savings is split between debts and savings. This form evenly splits the two, however this is not a rule, you should use your best judgement to maximize your savings contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally about 30% of your income may go to luxury/leisure spending. This category includes anything not considered a need, this includes but is not limited to: eating out, travel, fun activites (such as going to the movies), and even healthy expenses such as a gym membership.      
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The last category is your emergency fund. It is extremely important to keep between 3-6 months of your expenses in an emergency fund. A savings account should not be withdrawn from unless it is a planned purchase not included in your monthly needs. This type of expense is generally reserved for down payments (or even better cash purchases). If you are no longer bringing in income, you should not be using your savings to pay your bills. Your emergency fund is the cushion between your monthly expenses and your savings account.
